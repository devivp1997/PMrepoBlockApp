# Strategy Memo: Cloud Infrastructure as a Product

## Thesis

Internal cloud infrastructure should be treated as a product with defined users, roadmaps, and KPIs.

---

## Problem

Traditional IT governance models:
- Slow down teams
- Create shadow infrastructure
- Increase long-term risk

---

## Strategic Shift

Move from “approval-based IT” to “self-service guardrails.”

---

## Core Product Principles

1. Opinionated defaults
2. Secure-by-design templates
3. Self-service provisioning
4. Observability-first architecture

---

## Roadmap

Q1 → Governance foundation (Policies + Terraform modules)
Q2 → Developer self-service templates
Q3 → FinOps dashboards
Q4 → Automated threat detection scoring

---

## KPIs

- Mean time to provision
- Policy drift rate
- Cost per workload
- Security incident frequency
- Developer satisfaction score

---

## Risks

- Over-constraining developers
- Tooling adoption resistance
- Alert fatigue

Mitigation:
- Clear documentation
- Feedback loops
- Progressive rollout
